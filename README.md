Our AI based credit scoring system Final Year Project
- All involved members are credited in every document at the very start

A brief description:

The pdf files highlight a more detailed outlook of the pp and its developments at every stage of the project, here i cover a short description of what the app itself entails.

The problem description was to develop an AI based credit scoring model, we added to that by giving it a fully fledged webapp capable of dashboarding aswell as reporting, the scoring itself also follows the western standard of 400-800, the ML model uses a combination of MLP regressor and Histogram based gradient boosting.

The dataset used: https://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/pslm-hies-2018-19-microdata

How the data was prepared:

This part isn't intensively covered in the documents due to it being a last resort for data so i will explain it here;
The original data exists in STATA format, to decipher what the encoded data means the url provided also has manual guiding you, using the two i identified what each column and its values represented and from there on renamed the columns and values to match what they represent to then perform further data processing.

Project code files will not be shared directly on git, for access to the repository kindly reach out via email (erps and names mentioned in reports).

A few video links demoing the app:
